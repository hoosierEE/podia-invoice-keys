* Podia Invoice Keys
Podia changed CSV export format they use with Stripe. Previously a "Description" field contained the user-defined descriptive title. Now it's just a meaningless "Invoice #12345".

This script reads the Podia csv export and the Stripe csv export, gets the mapping from ~Invoice #~ to ~Description~ from the Podia csv and rewrites the corresponding fields in the Stripe csv. It writes an output file called ~output.csv~ which is essentially a modified version of the Stripe csv, but with the opaque invoice numbers replaced by human-readable descriptions.
